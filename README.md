Welcome to CVSU Go, a demo app showcasing the porting of a web-based platform to Android. Please note that this app is not affiliated with Cavite State University. Designed purely for entertainment during school vacations, CVSU Go offers a glimpse into the mobile adaptation of web functionalities. Built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, following a clean architecture approach. For inquiries about using my codebase, contact or email me at marcluis1187@gmail.com.
